This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship at CodSoft** â€” Task 1: Build a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**.

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook 
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

---

##  Results

-  **Accuracy:** 97.8%
- **Evaluation:** Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

---

##  What the Model Does

- Loads and cleans SMS message data
- Preprocesses text (removing stopwords, punctuation, stemming)
- Transforms text to numerical format using TF-IDF
- Trains a Logistic Regression model to classify messages
- Evaluates model performance on test data

## Special thanks
Huge thanks to **CodSoft** for this amazing opportunity to work on real-world ML tasks!
